Food Supply for the Needy - Salesforce Project
Project Overview
This Salesforce project is designed to help distribute leftover food to those in need, especially the underprivileged and poor. Through this system, we aim to minimize food wastage by connecting donors (such as restaurants, event organizers, or individuals) with NGOs or volunteers who can collect and deliver the food to those in need.

Features
Donor Registration: Allows users to register as food donors, listing details such as location, type of food, and estimated quantity available.
Food Availability Tracking: Keeps a real-time record of available food supplies from registered donors.
NGO and Volunteer Registration: Enables NGOs and volunteers to register for food pickup and distribution.
Request & Pickup Coordination: Connects donors with volunteers or NGOs for food collection and delivery, with status tracking for each request.
Notifications and Alerts: Sends notifications to volunteers/NGOs when a new donation is available, ensuring quick and efficient collection.
Reports and Analytics: Provides insights into the amount of food donated, number of beneficiaries, and overall impact.
