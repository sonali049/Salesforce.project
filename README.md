# Food Supply for the Needy - Salesforce Project



# Introduction

The "Food Supply for the Needy" Salesforce project is designed to address food wastage while supporting the underprivileged by facilitating the efficient distribution of surplus food to those in need. This system connects donors—such as restaurants, event organizers, and individuals with leftover food—to local NGOs and volunteers who can manage and deliver food to underserved communities. By creating a seamless, accessible platform for donations and pickups, this project ensures that excess food reaches those who need it most, reducing waste and contributing to food security efforts.

Through this project, donors can effortlessly register and list available food supplies, while NGOs and volunteers receive real-time notifications about donation opportunities in their vicinity. With coordination tools and impact-tracking reports, the project offers a comprehensive solution for making food accessibility streamlined and impactful.
